While I was using [permalinks](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-permalinks) for the updates content already, I've just moved the switched over the rest of the site to use it, as well. Because I am lazy, that means all the hardcoded links will break. As this is not a very serious site, I'm trusting this doesn't much matter. Or, well, hoping, at least.

This turned out to be a trickier job than I expected it to be, because pages can be nested into arbitrary folders, which was something I hadn't had to deal with when I was figuring out how to make the updates system work. You can see where things wound up on [the repo](https://github.com/darby3/chickenwing-gingerbreadman) if you poke around in the assemblefile.js file. Honestly I'm still not sure I can explain how this works. I think I grabbed some pieces from [the Assemble Workshop recipes](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-workshop) and then kind of banged on them until they worked. It's not pretty, but it seems to function well enough, for now.
