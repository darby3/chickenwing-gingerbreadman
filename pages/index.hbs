<h1>Welcome to my weird site</h1>

<p>What there is of it, anyway.</p>

<h2>Stuff I'd like to put on this site or that I randomly think about putting on this site</h2>

<ul class="simple-list-grid">
    <li>A "stuff I'm into" section, where I just keep adding whatever catches my eye in any shape or form</li>
    <li>Some quick-ref kind of stuff, specifically things about building this site, or sites in general; stuff that doesn't quite fit a narrow blog-post format</li>
    <li>Dumb experiments, like a personal codepen of sorts, or an archive of links to codepen-style experiments</li>
    <li>A running list of ideas for things I should be doing but am probably not doing</li>
    <li>Links to stuff I actually have done</li>
    <li>Links to resources that I have found useful in figuring out how to make this site</li>
    <li>Silly data visualizations</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Things I'm into at least enough to make a note of it here</h2>

            <h3>CSS Grid</h3>

            <p>I just love it. Gridding things makes me happy.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>This Proust quote</h3>

            <p>Which I need to go back and find and copy out here.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>My "2019 Ideas" shelf on GoodReads</h3>

            <p>It's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2337180-darby-dixon-iii?shelf=2019-ideas">a really fun list of books I might read this year or like in the course of my entire lifetime</a> that probably requires some additional explanation at some point.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>The album <em>Stuffed & Ready</em> by Cherry Glazerr</h3>

            <p>It's real good.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Pencils</h3>

            <p>Thanks to <a href="https://cwpencils.com/">CW Pencil Enterprise</a> for being a cool store that I gave a bunch of money to recently.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>The PlayStation 5 offering backwards compatibility for PlayStation 4 games</h3>

            <p>Not that I'm playing as much these days as I'd like but oh it's good to know I can continue to buy games without worrying about whether I'll have hardware to play them on if I upgrade my system someday.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><em>The Cartel</em> by Don Winslow</h3>

            <p>I'm fairly certain this book rivals most any post-apocalyptic book I've ever read in the body-count column.</p>
