            <p>My
                <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> queue has about 8000 items in it; which is absurd. Mostly because I started dumping anything into it, not just things I want to read, but resources, other links, etc. I've put a moratorium on my Pocket use until I
                <a href="https://github.com/darby3/pocket_data_processor">sort out the archive of links I downloaded</a>; at which point I'll clear it out and start using it correctly. In the meantime I've started dumping things into a messy unsorted bookmarks folder. Just as fun, maybe almost as useful!

            <p>In the sense that I'm trying to learn it and incorporate it and make it
                <em>just part of what I do</em>, something more than a checkbox that gets checked at some point. I have a lot to learn yet. And that said it seems like

            <p>Not that I'm playing as much these days as I'd like but oh it's good to know I can continue to buy games without worrying about whether I'll have hardware to play them on if I upgrade my system someday.</p>

            <p>I'm fairly certain this book rivals most any post-apocalyptic book I've ever read in the body-count column.</p>
